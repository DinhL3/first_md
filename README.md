## Why I am interested in this course
My brother-in-law, a dev in the US, recommended this course. I want to learn web development to make beautiful, functional websites, and make a lot of money.

## Worries
I want to make *great products*. However, I am afraid that companies in Vietnam would make me **overwork** and give me **low salary**.
