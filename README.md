## Programming experience
I created my blog **3 years ago** using **Wordpress (PHP)**.

## Why I am interested in this course
My brother-in-law, a dev in the US, recommended this course. I want to learn web development to make beautiful, functional websites, and make a lot of money.

## Worries
I want to make *great products*. However, I am afraid that companies in Vietnam would make me *overwork* and give me *low salary*.

## Favorite quote
> The definition of power is not financial success, status, or influence over others, but the degree to which we have control over our own lives.

## My favorite music
I am watching *Attack on Titan* so I have been listening to its opening music repeatedly.
